# Dataset: Class Marks

## Description
This dataset contains students' scores across multiple questions in an exam. Each column represents a different question, with some having sub-parts. The dataset includes missing values, which indicate that the student did not attempt or answer the respective question.

## File Information
- **Filename:** class_marks.csv
- **Total Rows:** 86
- **Total Columns:** 12

## Column Descriptions
1. **Total** - The total marks obtained by the student.
2. **Q1aM4** - Score for Question 1a (Maximum: 4)
3. **Q1bM6** - Score for Question 1b (Maximum: 6)
4. **Q2aM6** - Score for Question 2a (Maximum: 6)
5. **Q2bM4** - Score for Question 2b (Maximum: 4)
6. **Q3aM5** - Score for Question 3a (Maximum: 5)
7. **Q3bM5** - Score for Question 3b (Maximum: 5)
8. **Q4aM3** - Score for Question 4a (Maximum: 3)
9. **Q4bM7** - Score for Question 4b (Maximum: 7)
10. **Q5M10** - Score for Question 5 (Maximum: 10)
11. **Q6aM4** - Score for Question 6a (Maximum: 4)
12. **Q6bM6** - Score for Question 6b (Maximum: 6)

## Data Characteristics
- The dataset contains **numerical** values, with some missing values.
- The maximum possible marks for each question are indicated in the column name (e.g., Q1aM4 means max 4 marks for Question 1a).
- Missing values are represented as `NaN`.

## Usage
This dataset can be used for:
- Analyzing student performance.
- Identifying trends in question difficulty.
- Understanding scoring distribution.

## Notes
- Ensure to handle missing values appropriately when analyzing the dataset.
- The `Total` column represents the sum of all question scores per student.
- Some students may not have attempted certain questions, resulting in missing values.


# Dataset: State Transaction Data

## Description
This dataset contains records of transactions between different states, including details about the home and sale states, transaction counts, and time of transaction.

## File Information
- **Filename:** cb.csv
- **Total Rows:** 329
- **Total Columns:** 7

## Column Descriptions
1. **homestatecode** - Numerical code representing the home state.
2. **salestatecode** - Numerical code representing the sale state.
3. **month** - Month of the transaction.
4. **year** - Year of the transaction.
5. **txn_count** - Number of transactions recorded.
6. **salestatename** - Name of the sale state.
7. **homestatename** - Name of the home state.

## Data Characteristics
- The dataset consists of **numerical and categorical** values.
- `homestatecode` and `salestatecode` are **integer identifiers** for states.
- `month` and `year` represent the **time frame** of the transactions.
- `txn_count` represents the **number of transactions** between the states.
- `homestatename` and `salestatename` are **state names** corresponding to their codes.

## Usage
This dataset can be used for:
- Analyzing inter-state transaction trends.
- Identifying high-transaction volume states.
- Understanding seasonal variations in transactions.

## Notes
- Ensure to filter data by `year` and `month` for time-series analysis.
- Use `homestatecode` and `salestatecode` if mapping transactions to state codes.
- Data can be visualized using heatmaps or network graphs to represent state-wise transaction flow.

# Dataset: SEM2 MID 1 

## Description
This dataset contains mid-term examination scores for students in Section ALPHA for Semester 2. Each column represents a different subject, and the dataset includes missing values in some columns.

## File Information
- **Filename:** MIDMARKS.xlsx
- **Sheet Name:** SEM2 MID 1 - ALPHA
- **Total Rows:** 718
- **Total Columns:** 8

## Column Descriptions
1. **S.NO** - Serial number of the student (some missing values).
2. **SECTION** - Section name of the student (expected to be "ALPHA").
3. **DV** - Score in subject DV.
4. **M-II** - Score in subject M-II.
5. **PP** - Score in subject PP.
6. **BEEE** - Score in subject BEEE.
7. **FL** - Score in subject FL.
8. **FIMS** - Score in subject FIMS.

## Data Characteristics
- The dataset consists of **numerical and categorical** values.
- The `S.NO` column contains some missing values.
- Subject scores are stored as object types and may need conversion to numeric for analysis.
- Missing values in scores might indicate absent students or unrecorded marks.

## Usage
This dataset can be used for:
- Analyzing student performance in mid-term exams.
- Identifying trends in subject-wise performance.
- Evaluating overall class performance for Semester 2.

## Notes
- Ensure to handle missing values appropriately before analysis.
- Convert score columns to numeric format if necessary.
- Data can be visualized using histograms or bar charts for better insights into student performance.
