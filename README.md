- Identifying trends in subject-wise performance.
- Evaluating overall class performance for Semester 2.

## Notes
- Ensure to handle missing values appropriately before analysis.
- Convert score columns to numeric format if necessary.
- Data can be visualized using histograms or bar charts for better insights into student performance.

# Dataset: Titanic Passenger Information
